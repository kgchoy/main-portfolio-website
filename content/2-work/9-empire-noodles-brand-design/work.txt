## About

(image: empire-noodles-logo.png alt: Empire Noodles logo)

This project was completed in a team of two for a graphic design course. The aim was to design a brand identity for a fictional small business we would be starting, complete with a logo design, business card, and letterhead. Our choice of business was a Taiwanese noodle shop inside of a food court.

## Process

Our logo's denotations and connotations were chosen to reinforce our mission statement: "To serve delicious, traditional hand-made noodles at a low price, while maintaining fast and reliable service." For example, the king and his crown represented high prestige, symbolic of the high quality of our menu offerings. At the same time, the comedic, cartoon-style logo implied casualness (due to the food court location). The main colours in the logo were based on the major prestigious colours in Chinese culture.

The logo ideation process required rapid sketching to discover which logo was the best option, followed by creating versions of our more preferred sketches in Illustrator. I contributed to all stages of the design process, with heavier involvement during the later vector design stages.

## Outcomes

Our branding positively represented our business and communicated our mission statement. In addition, as our design elements were consistent and complemented each other, it created the feeling of a unified brand. Personally, I strengthened my experience with branding and graphic design, and I improved my Illustrator skills.
