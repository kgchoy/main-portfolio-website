## About

(image: empire-noodles-logo.png alt: Empire Noodles logo)

This project was completed in a team of two for a graphic design course. The aim was to design a brand identity for a fictional small business we would be starting, complete with a logo design, business card, and letterhead. Our choice of business was a Taiwanese noodle shop inside of a food court.

## Process

All of our design elements &ndash; colours, typefaces, symbolism, and so forth &ndash; reinforced our mission statement: "To serve delicious, traditional hand-made noodles at a low price, while maintaining fast and reliable service." For example, the king and his crown on the logo represented high prestige, symbolic of the high quality of our menu offerings. At the same time, the comedic, cartoon-style logo implied casualness (due to the food court setting).

In our team of two, responsibilities during the ideation process were evenly split; I did research for company ideas and target audiences, and sketched logo ideas. However, I played a larger role with the final deliverables, in which I created the high-fidelity logo and branding application graphics.

## Outcomes

Our branding positively represented our business and communicated our mission statement. In addition, as our design elements were consistent and complemented each other, it created the feeling of a unified brand. Personally, I strengthened my experience with branding and graphic design, and I improved my Illustrator skills.
