## Page Creation, Hosting & Testing
All of my pages are hand-coded using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP using (link: http://www.sublimetext.com text: Sublime Text). The HTML and CSS code is valid to the greatest extent possible, although I use elements such as embedded Vimeo videos on some pages, which will break validity.

Content is served using the (link: http://getkirby.com/ text: Kirby) flat-file content management system.

Site testing is done using Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer/Edge, Safari, and Opera, in addition to various mobile browsers.

(link: http://piwik.org/ text: Piwik) is used for site analytics. This data is anonymized, and I won't track users who opt out of tracking using the (link: http://donottrack.us/ text: Do Not Track) preference on their browsers.
