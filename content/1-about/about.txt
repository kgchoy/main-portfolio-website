Title: About Me

About-Section:

Hello, and welcome! My name is Kevin Choy, and I am a user experience designer, developer, and researcher. I currently work as a UI/UX Designer at (link: https://www.fortinet.com/ text: Fortinet). Previously, I had worked as a UX/UI Designer and Developer at (link: https://d3security.com text: D3 Security) for two years.

I have experience in understanding how current and potential users might use an interactive product throughout every step of the development process, from conceptualization to product evaluation. The success of organizations and their products is highly dependent on understanding the users' needs and wants. As a result, I believe that user research and usability testing is just as important as interaction design and designing the right user interface.

I graduated from (link: http://www.sfu.ca text: Simon Fraser University) in 2015, where I majored in (link: http://www.sfu.ca/siat.html text: Interactive Arts &amp; Technology) with a concentration in Interactive Systems and minored in Computing Science. I have previously done co-op positions at (link: http://www.activenetwork.com/ text: ACTIVE Network) as an Email & Website Developer/Designer and at (link: http://bccampus.ca/ text: BCcampus) as a Communications Research Assistant.

I am passionate about improving the state of public education, even (link: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2013AVED0013-001345 text: endorsing the BC Open Textbook Project in a Government of British Columbia press release). I have also had a lifelong interest in the study of human geography&mdash;particularly urban studies and the geography of transportation. These interests have shaped my creative design process, as well as the types of design topics I explore.

In my spare time, I enjoy activities such as hiking, board games &amp; tabletop games, badminton, and retrogaming. I'm an active member of the Burnaby Mountain Toastmasters public speaking club, and was previously an executive of the club for over two years.
